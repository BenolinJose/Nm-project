TITLE : Sign Language Translation Tool.
PURPOSE: The goal of sign language translation tools is to help people who are deaf or hard of hearing communicate with people who speak spoken languages more often. By translating gestures in sign language into spoken or written language and vice versa, they help, people to communicate.
TECHNOLOGY USED: MediaPipe:-Landmark extraction and hand detection
                   OpenCV :- Video processing and computer vision tasks
                   Scikit-learn: KNN classifier for machine learning
                   Pandas: Data processing (CSV, features/labels)
                   NumPy :- Numerical operations
                   Matplotlib: Colab's frame-by-frame visualization
                   Google Colab: Executing the code in the cloud while uploading UI 
USAGE : By translating signs into text or speech and vice versa, sign language translation tools help people who use sign language and those who don't communicate with each other. These resources can be applied in a variety of contexts to encourage deaf and hard-of-hearing accessibility and inclusion.
